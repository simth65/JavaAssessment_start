# JavaAssessment_start
Java Assessment - Mar 2022 intake
What did you like about this project?
This assessment is quite challenging, it requires quite a fair bit of thinking, planning and understanding how the Classes related to each other.
I like it that it challenged my thought process.
What did you struggle with in this project?
It was mind-boggling at first, but taking a step by step and focus on each individual requirement helps to get the assessment completed finally.
What would make your experience with this assessment better?
For an assessment, I think this is challenging enough. 
I enhanced the requirement by adding custom exception for user input to the date and number range (1-6).  
Prompted user with a custom exception when user enters a date > current system date and if the number range is NOT 1-6.
